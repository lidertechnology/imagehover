# ImageHover

With this library, developers can enhance the visual appeal of their projects by adding animated transitions to their images when users hover over them. As an open-source project, the library is free to use, modify, and distribute under certain licensing conditions.

## Install

### npm

```
npm i @zkreations/imagehover
```

### cdn

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@zkreations/imagehover@1/main.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
```

## Basic Usage

After including the library in your project, you just have to use the following HTML structure, replacing ``img-fade`` with an effect that you can copy from the [demonstration page](https://zkreations.github.io/imagehover/):

```html
<figure class="img-fade">
  <img src="example.jpg">
  <figcaption>Text here</figcaption>
</figure>
```
